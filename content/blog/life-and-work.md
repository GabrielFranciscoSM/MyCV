# The meaining of work

Work is a fundamental part of our lives. It is how we earn a living, and basically how we survive nowadays. 
And, even more important, it can be a source of personal fulfillment and satisfaction. While work is allways 
work, it can be a source of joy and happiness if we find the right job.

However, this is not the point of the reflexion. The point is that work is not everything, and morover, 
work is a means to an end.
We work to live, not live to work.

## What is work?

Is it work the thing we do to earn money? Or is it the thing we do to be happy? 
I think it is a little bit of both, if we are lucky. Work should be pleasant, but 
it is allways work: A source of money; A place where you have to produce, by definition.

## The pressure 

As a computer science student, my work is studying, programming and passing exams. But as a 
future computer science professional, I also need to stay up to date with the latest technologies,
and be able to adapt to the fast pace of the industry. 

This is life, and not a specially hard one, I now. But while I study my exams, code my next project
and explore this or that technology, I ask to myself:
Is this what I want? To spend the rest of my days like this?

## The balance

For me, work is essential, but life is more important. 

The meainig of work is to respond to your dedication and your effort, 
returning happiness and satisfaction. Or, at least, leting you live your life.
