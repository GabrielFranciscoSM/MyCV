# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this post, I'll walk you through creating your first React component.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Creating Your First Component

Here's a simple example of a React component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This component takes a `name` prop and renders a heading with a greeting.

## Key Concepts

1. **Components**: The building blocks of React applications
2. **Props**: Data passed from parent to child components
3. **State**: Internal component data that can change over time

## Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused
- Use functional components when possible
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
