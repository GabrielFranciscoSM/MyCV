In this post, I'll walk you through creating your first React component.\n\n## What is React?\n\nReact is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called \"components\".\n\n## Creating Your First Component\n\nHere's a simple example of a React component:\n\n```jsx\nfunction Welcome(props) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;\n}\n```\n\nThis component takes a `name` prop and renders a heading with a greeting.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n1. **Components**: The building blocks of React applications\n2. **Props**: Data passed from parent to child components\n3. **State**: Internal component data that can change over time\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Keep components small and focused\n- Use functional components when possible\n- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle\n",
